# hash_map
An implementation of the HashMap data structure in Ruby with some basic functions. Also includes an implementation of the HashSet data structure in Ruby with some of the same functions.

Overall, this project allowed me not only to elevate my knowledge of DSA but also to increase my programming skills in general. I found it extremely rewarding to see the process of creating the HashMap and HashSet data structures from start to finish. I extremely enjoyed seeing how the data fit within the system at the end. Also, it was extremely interesting to see how we can manipulate data into the form we want it, and how, with basic programming skills (hashing), we can easily add security within an application.
